## Introduction

Build the "Zooniverse", a fictional location from the television series, [*The Mighty Boosh*](http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/mightyboosh/clips/episodes_series1.shtml).

Let the tests drive your development.


## Objectives

* Building objects in ruby
* Object composition
* Practice Test Driven Development (TDD)


## Instructions



```
$ rake spec  # => failing test
```

##### Step 2: Green

Write some code to make the test pass.

```
$ rake spec  # => passing test
```

##### Step 3: Refactor

Evaluate and improve what you have written. Refactor your code by extracting duplication into methods. Extract functionality into classes. [Red, green, refactor](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/12/17/TheCyclesOfTDD.html).
